# static_profile_page

A Flutter app that displays a static profile page. This is a precursor to my dynamic profile page app. The profile page is static, which means the information is hardcoded. Making the page static made the layout easy to design before moving on to a dynamic profile page. The dynamic profile page app will allow the user to enter in the profile information prior to displaying the page. For the dynamic profile app, I am learning how to use an SQFlite based database to allow for multiple profiles to be stored.
